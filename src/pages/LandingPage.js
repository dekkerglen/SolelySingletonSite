            each year with approximately 10 episodes per season. Episodes are planned with specific focuses such as
            drafter oriented or new cube designer episodes. Season are balanced in the types of episodes contained

            The show has grown over the past year from a humble beginning. Transforming from a pair of friends
            discussing cube with a cheap microphone in a makeshift studio into a pair of friends discussing cube with
            two much more expensive microphones in a makeshift studio with thousands of weekly listeners with the help
            of dozens of supporters. Solely Singleton has become the premier cube podcast with the help of loyal
            listeners and supportive fans, for whom the hosts are eternally thankful.
